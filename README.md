Being an absolute unit, creating the best machine learning model.

The goal of the challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict heat island hotspots in an urban location. 

Additionally, the model should be designed to discern and highlight the key factors that contribute significantly to the development of these hotspots within city environments.
